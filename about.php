          All Concat members welcome you. <br>
          Concat website is originally a social networking site, but it is for the college, including its members. <br>
          Concat aims to strengthen the link between students and doctors. <br>
          Concat also aims to make the relationship between alumni and the college a close relationship. Even after graduation, graduates can communicate with doctors and benefit from their experiences in the affairs of their lives. It also benefits younger students
